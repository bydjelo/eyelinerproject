        <p > 1. Know the difference between pencil, gel and liquid; </p><br>
            <img src="https://experthometips.com/images/content/1348-680x408.png">
<p>There are three main types of eyeliner:<br>

1.Pencil - matte and easy to apply, this is a great eyeliner for novices. Does not spread as smoothly as gel or liquid, but mistakes can be easily blended for a smokey eye effect.<br>
2.Gel - mostly come in matte effect, they apply very smoothly. Can be used for both thin and thicker lines.<br>
3.Liquid - create precision lines. Most have a pen or nib to apply, like a felt tip pen. Create a very thin line but can be used for a thicker effect, too.</p>
            
            <p>2. Hold your eye for more control: </p> <br>
    
    <p>
        You'll find that most liners tend to get stuck or skip across your lid, so start off by creating a smooth canvas for your liner to glide across. Using your pointer and middle finger, pull the skin above your eye taut for a smoother, more precise line. Instead of free-handing it, prop your elbow up on the counter to steady your hand. Just be sure not to manhandle the delicate skin around your eye - you don't want to tug too hard and risk stretching or damaging the skin.       
            
</p>
            <p> 3.Use a primer: <br></p>
            <p>  When you take pains to draw a gorgeous cat-eye, you don't want it rubbing off after a couple hours. Use an eye primer first to create a base that will help your liner last all day.</p>
        <p> 4. Fix a mistake with a cotton swab: </p> <br>
        <p> Mess up? Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Instead of starting from scratch, dip a cotton swab in makeup remover and use it like an eraser to carefully remove any mistakes. Just remember to get to it quickly - it's easier and less of a mess to erase it while it's wet than it is when it sets into your skin.</p>
